    "We covered the perceptron learning algorithm in class. In short, you are given a table of training data, with samples and their corresponding labels. Each row represents one training sample. The perceptron learning algorithm starts with arbitrary weights and bias, and uses the training data to incrementally modify these weights and bias until the perceptron can correctly classify the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will write a program to implement the perceptron learning algorithm on a 2-dimensional example. You are given 2-dimensional data, which you can think of as points in a plane, and each point has a label, which you can think of as a color. The data is linearly separable, which means there exists some line in the plane that separates the two colors. Your program will update the weights and the bias in such a way that makes the perceptron correctly classify the given training data. This corresponds to drawing the correct line between the different-colored points. \n",

    "First, you will design a series of functions that perform different steps of the algorithm.  \n",
